# Reflection on the game development



## Psychology

I learn many psychology through online learning. Those will affect the design of our game. For example:

- The obstacle damage: The player tend to feel good and get a sense of control when making the collider a little bit smaller than the visual size to damage the player. 
- Why I change to not show the timer? I want to decrease the anxiety of timing.
  - use hunger?
